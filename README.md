# ItemInfoDisplayForkedCNPlus (PEAK)

适配 PEAK 新版本的物品信息显示模组，包含中文本地化。
Forked from jkqt and chuxiaaaa, updated for current PEAK versions.
I will update promptly after game updates when time allows.

## Features
- Status Changes (e.g. Hunger, Poison)
- Weight
- Remaining Item Uses
- Cookability
- Number of Times Cooked
- Some Effects & Afflictions

This mod is mainly for getting the numbers on consumable items.
It has limited quantification of equipment effects such as ropes (and remedy fungus).

## Config
- Font Size
- Text Outline Width
- Line Spacing
- Size Delta X (suboptimal workaround to move the text horizontally)
- Force Update Time
- Enable Test Mode (cycle items with F1/F2, log with F3)

## Installation
1. Install `BepInEx-BepInExPack_PEAK`.
2. Place the mod DLL into `BepInEx/plugins`.

## Credits
Thanks to:
- jkqt for the original ItemInfoDisplay mod. [GitHub](https://github.com/jkqt/ItemInfoDisplay)
- chuxiaaaa for the CN localization and maintenance. [GitHub](https://github.com/chuxiaaaa/ItemInfoDisplay)

This fork updates the mod for newer PEAK versions and keeps localization improvements.
